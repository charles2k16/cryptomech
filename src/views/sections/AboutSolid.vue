              The Solid Protocol acts as a bridge that could take any supply of
              any market and convert it into a “Solid version” of the market. It
              creates a stable market that the price is adjusted non-linearly,
              in which it is a more stabilized market and could be considered as
              a subset of the original market.

              Our vision is to create a new kind of “stablecoin” that has the
              ability to absorb and rise with inflation. As well as a built in
              “shorting” mechanism that lets holders earn on red candle days.
